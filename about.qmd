Hi, I am Anoj and have special interest in physics, mathematics and computation. Besides academia, I love to walk though the wilderness and explore nature. Don't ask me if I am interested in music, it is in my blood. In this personal website of mine I will write on topics of my above mentioned interests both academic and non-academic.
