## Bio

Just like the music is written and understood by musicians in a coded language, what is the language with which natural laws are written. Physicists claim - it is laws of phsyics condensed as an elegant matematical equations that is the language by which nature speaks. Why would nature chose to speak in such a difficult language of mathematics? Or, is it that nature speaks in many different languages, it's only upto the observer to understand it. These are the philosophical questions I love to ruminate about.

**Interests:** Hiking, Travelling, Scientific Computing, Inquiring why things are the way they are.
