As we can see as we approximate with larger and larger number of terms in the series given function is more and more accurately represented. \n",

Discrete fourier transform and fast fourier transform are the successive results that arises on the foundationi of fourier analysis.

Once again, mathematics lies at the base of the beauty of everything. "
