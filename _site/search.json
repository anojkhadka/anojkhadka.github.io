Physicists claim - it is laws of phsyics condensed as an elegant matematical equations that is the language by which nature speaks. Why would nature chose to speak in such a difficult language of mathematics? Or, is it that nature speaks in many different languages, it’s only upto the observer to understand it. These are the philosophical questions I love to ruminate about.\nInterests: Hiking, Travelling, Scientific Computing, Inquiring why things are the way they are.\n\n\n\ncontact me."
