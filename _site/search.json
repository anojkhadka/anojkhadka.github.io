Physicists claim - it is laws of phsyics condensed as an elegant matematical equations that is the language by which nature speaks. Why would nature chose to speak in such a difficult language of mathematics? Or, is it that nature speaks in many different languages, it’s only upto the observer to understand it. These are the philosophical questions I love to ruminate about."

    "text": "Hi, I am Anoj and have special interest in physics, mathematics and computation. I am a graduate student in physics department here at West Virginia University. Broadly speaking, I am working on pulsar astronomy. Currently, I am focused on two different research projects. One of them involves searching for pulsars for which I use open source softwares to explore data from various radio telescopes. Parallelly, I also work on new algorithm developments for various aspects of pulsar astronomy. Besides academia, I love to walk through the wilderness and explore nature. Don’t ask me if I am interested in music, it is in my blood. In this personal website of mine I will write on topics of my above mentioned interests both academic and non-academic. You can mail me at khadkaanoj@gmail.com."
