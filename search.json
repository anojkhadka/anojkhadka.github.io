    "text": "Just like the music is written and understood by musicians in a coded language, what is the language with which nature speaks. Physicists claim - nature communicates in a language of elegant matematical equations. Why would nature chose to speak in such a difficult language of mathematics? Or, is it that nature speaks in many different languages, it’s only upto the observer to understand it. These are the philosophical questions I love to ruminate about.\nIn short, human civilization is a story of journey into the unknown and this journey into the unknown has sometimes been ispired by curiosity and at times by necessity. I also wonder why things are the way they are. On some dark night, alone in the wilderness, looking up in the sky, do you ever wonder where did this all come from. In the vastness of the universe, I feel helpless, insignificant and hopeless. However, the joy I find in being able to understand miniscule of the vastness of the universe is inspiring."

    "text": "Hi, I am Anoj and have special interest in physics, mathematics and computation. I am a graduate student in physics department here at West Virginia University. Broadly speaking, I am working on pulsar astronomy. Currently, I am focused on two different research projects. One of them involves searching for pulsars for which I use open source softwares to explore data from various radio telescopes. Parallelly, I also work on new algorithm developments for various aspects of pulsar astronomy. Besides academia, I love to walk through the wilderness and explore nature. Don’t ask me if I am interested in music, it is in my blood. In this personal website of mine I will write on topics of my above mentioned interests, both academic and non-academic. In case you want to contact me, my email is khadkaanoj@gmail.com."
