    "text": "Just like the music is written and understood by musicians in a coded language, what is the language with which nature speaks. Physicists claim - nature communicates in a language of elegant matematical equations. Why would nature chose to speak in such a difficult language of mathematics? Or, is it that nature speaks in many different languages, it’s only upto the observer to understand it. These are the philosophical questions I love to ruminate about.\nIn short, human civilization is a story of journey into the unknown and this journey into the unknown has sometimes been ispired by curiosity and at times by necessity. I also wonder why things are the way they are. On some dark night, alone in the wilderness, looking up in the sky, do you ever wonder where did this all come from. In the vastness of the universe, I feel helpless, insignificant and hopeless. However, the joy I find in being able to understand miniscule of the vastness of the universe is inspiring."

    "text": "Mandelbrot Set\nMandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers that obey certain mathematical rule. First studied by Robert Brooks and Peter Matelski and visualized by Benoit Mandelbrot while woking in IBM, it represents the complexity and has many applications in the study of chaos theory, number theory, fractal geometry, etc. Mathematically, it is defined by a simple function:\n\\[x_{n} = x_{0}^2 + c  \\]\nwhere ‘c’ is a set of complex numbers and ‘\\(x_{0}\\)’ is 0. This set of such complex numbers for which the functional value defined above does not diverge even at infinity, comprises a Mandelbrot set. Starting with \\(x_{0} = 0\\) and any complex number ’c` we keep summing up the numbers iteratively as:\n\\[ x_{1} = 0 + c \\] \\[ x_{2} = x_{1}^2 + c \\] \\[ x_{3} = x_{2}^2 + c \\] \\[..........\\] \\[..........\\] \\[..........\\]\n\\[ x_{n} = x_{n-1}^2 + c \\]\nEven when we take this sum to infinity, if the sum does not diverge from the complex number ‘c’, the number belongs to a Mandelbrot set. Here the \\(x_{0}\\) is called a seed and the summation orbit of the seed. So, Mandelbrot set is a set of these complex numbers for which the orbit of the seed 0 does not diverge to infinity.\nWhen we make a plot of Mandelbrot set, it gives rise to form a beautiful looking design pattern as shown below. Generally, we use complex nubers \\(z = x + iy\\) within x and y values ranging in between (-2,2). It has been derived mathematically that this series will converge below a radius of 2 when seed is 0 for given set of complex numbers in above range of x and y values. So, we use this radius as a braking/limiting condition for our iteration loop.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef mandelbrot_set(lower_limit, upper_limit, total_number, max_iteration):\n    \n    \"\"\" This function will first create a 2-D array of zeros. We then create complex numbers within a complex plane with x and y \n    values ranging between (-1.5, 1.5). These complex numbers are each tested to see if iterative sum exceeds the radius of \n    convergence value 2 when seed of 0 is taken. If value diverge we change that complex number in the complex plane to 1.\n    Finally a plot of these 2-D matrix set is created to visualize the mandelbrot set. One can tweak the seed value and range of\n    complex numbers taken just to see how the graph changes.\"\"\"\n    \n    blank_set = np.zeros((total_number,total_number))\n    number_sample = np.linspace(lower_limit, upper_limit, total_number)\n    for n1 in range(total_number):\n        x = number_sample[n1]\n        for n2 in range(total_number):\n            y = number_sample[n2]\n            c = complex(x,y)                              # Complex number to test\n            z = 0                                         # Seed number\n            for k in range(max_iteration):\n                z = z**2 + c\n                if abs(z) &gt; 2:\n                    blank_set[n1,n2] = 1\n                    break\n    return blank_set\n\n\ndef mandelbrot_graph(mandel_set):\n    plt.figure(figsize=(12,12))\n    plt.imshow(mandel_set, extent=(-2.0, 2.0, -2.0, 2.0))\n\ndef main():\n    result1 = mandelbrot_set(-1.5, 1.5,1024,300)\n    result2 = mandelbrot_graph(result1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is based on the reference source linked below.\nhttps://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/FRACGEOM/FRACGEOM.html"

Broadly speaking, I am working on pulsar astronomy. Currently, I am focused on two different research projects. One of them involves searching for pulsars for which I use open source softwares to explore data from various radio telescopes. Parallelly, I also work on new algorithm developments for various aspects of pulsar astronomy. Besides academia, I love to walk through the wilderness and explore nature. Don’t ask me if I am interested in music, it is in my blood. In this personal website of mine I will write on topics of my above mentioned interests, both academic and non-academic.

    "text": "We use Maclaurin’s series expansion to approximate a function which is continuous and for which the higher order derivative exists. Remember, Maclaurin series is a Taylor’s series of a function expanded at reference point 0. For instance, Maclaurin’s expansion of \\(sin(x)\\) is given by:\n\\[sin(x) = x - \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\frac{x^5}{120}\\]\nThis comes from the Maclaurin’s series expansion of \\(sin(x)\\).\nMaclaurin’s series expansion is given by:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{n}(0)}{n!}x^n  \\]\nHigher order derivatives for function \\(sin(x)\\) exists and is a continuous function so it can be approximated to the desired accuracy(provided that required computational resource exists) using Maclaurin’s series expansion. But how would we model a discontinuous function such as one defined below:\n\\[f(x) = x\\] in the range -2&lt;x&lt;2. Grpahically this function looks as shown below.\n\n\n\nFunction Graph\n\n\nWe can model such discontinuous function using Fourier series given by:\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{a_{0}}{2} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left[ a_{n}Cos\\left(\\frac{2n\\pi x}{L}\\right) + b_{n}Sin\\left(\\frac{2n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]  \\]\nRefer this source for theoretical aspect of fourier seiries.\nGiven function in the example is an odd function so the function can only be modelled with coefficient \\(b_{n}\\) as all the \\(a_{n}, a_{0}\\) coefficient will be zero for odd function. Using Fourier integral for fourier coefficient \\(b_{n}\\) I got the value\n\\[ b_{n} =  \\frac{4 (-1)^{n+1}}{n \\pi}  \\]\nHence, given function will be modelled by the fourier series expression below.\n\\[ f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{4 (-1)^{n+1}}{n \\pi} Sin\\left(\\frac{n \\pi x}{2}\\right) \\right] \\]\nUsing this result we can visualize how given function will be modelled if we take fourier series sum for various number of terms in above series. Below is a graph there shows how the actual function(in blue) will be modelled by fourier series when we take a sum of 1, 5, 25 and 125 terms. As we can see as we approximate with larger and larger number of terms in the series given function is more and more accurately represented.\nThis is the power of fourier series that it can be used to model discontinuous function. Discrete fourier transform and fast fourier transform are the successive results that arises on the foundationi of fourier analysis. All modern electronic devices such as cell phones, radio communication, etc use this idea of fast fourier transform in signal processing. Once again, mathematics lies at the base of the beauty of everything.\n\n\n\nFourier Graph"
